## NZBGet extensions

This repository contains a list of NZBGet extensions, which is used by the Extension manager to download and update them.

## If you want to add your extension to this list, you will need

1. Make your extension compatible with NZBGet spec v23+. 
[This](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget/blob/develop/docs/extensions/EXTENSIONS.md) doc can help you with that.

2. If you think your extension is ready for release, you will need a repository for storing and releasing it
in the nzbgetcom organization, e.g. `https://github.com/nzbgetcom/Extension-YourExtensionName/`. 
Just ask one of the NZBGet maintainers to assist you with that.

3. Create a fork of that repository, add your extension to it, and make a Pull request.

4. After approval and merging you will be able to add your extension to the 
[extensions.json](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget-extensions/blob/main/extensions.json) list which 
will be automatically picked up by the Extension Manager.

>You can use any of nzbgetcom extension as example,
